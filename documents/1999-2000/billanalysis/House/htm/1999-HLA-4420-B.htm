PROBLEM:</EM></STRONG></FONT><FONT

<BR>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Public Act 17 of 1963, known as the "Good Samaritan"
law, provides immunity from civil liability to certain authorized medical
personnel who in good faith render medical aid in emergency situations, except where an act or
omission amounts to gross
negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct.  The act was amended in 1986 to grant immunity
from liability to any person who
performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in an emergency (regardless of whether the
person had any training in the
technique), and again in 1987 to grant immunity to physicians who in good faith and without
compensation, performed physical
examinations on persons to determine their fitness to engage in competitive sports. The 1987
legislation also granted immunity to
health care professionals giving emergency care to participants injured during competition, and
to registered members of the
National Ski Patrol.  The reasoning behind such legislation was to encourage bystanders to help
accident and heart attack victims
and to encourage health professionals to render medical care to nonpatients in an emergency or
as volunteers with schools without
fear of being sued by the people they attempt to help.  </FONT></P>

<BR>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">With the development in recent years of automated
external defibrillators (AEDs), devices that analyze a heart attack victim's heart
rhythm and automatically deliver the appropriate electric shock necessary to restore a regular
rhythm, a medical procedure that was
once only in the purview of trained medical professionals and certain emergency personnel such
as paramedics can now be
performed by the average person.  Though the machines have been shown in several studies to
increase the survivability of certain
types of cardiac arrest, many people have been resistant to the widespread availability and
placement of AEDs in police cars and
public access areas such as shopping malls, stadiums, and fitness clubs due to fears over liability. 
To address this concern, 
legislation has been offered to place language in statute that is similar to the provision pertaining
to laypersons giving CPR and
physicians rendering emergency care, thereby extending immunity from civil liability to anyone
using an AED on a heart attack victim.

BILL:</EM></STRONG></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><EM></EM></FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"></FONT></P>

<BR>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><U>House Bill 4420</U> would amend Public Act 17
of 1963, known as the Good Samaritan law, to limit the liability of persons who used an
automated external defibrillator (AED) to render emergency service to another person.  
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">An individual who had no duty to render emergency
service would not be liable for damages in a civil action arising out of the good
faith use of an AED to treat another person.  Further, the bill would also extend immunity from
civil suits to a physician providing
medical authorization for use of an AED, an individual who instructed others in the use of an
AED, and an individual or entity that
owned, occupied, or managed the premises where an AED was located or used.   However, in
each case, this immunity would not
apply where the actions of the individual providing the treatment amounted to gross negligence
or willful and wanton misconduct. </FONT></P>

<BR>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The immunity provided by the bill would only apply to
civil actions filed or pending on or after the bill's effective date.  (<U>Note</U>: The bill
was filed with the Office of Secretary of State on November 16, 1999.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><STRONG><EM>BACKGROUND
INFORMATION:</EM></STRONG></FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"><EM></EM></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"></FONT></P>

<BR>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the most common
arrhythmia of the heart leading to sudden cardiac arrest.  During VF, the heart is
unable to pump blood because the muscles contract chaotically instead of in a coordinated
fashion.  According to Dr. Myron</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Weisfeldt of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in
New York City, a speaker at the March, 1998, conference of the American
College of Cardiology, VF accounts for approximately 70 percent of the cases of cardiac arrest,
with the single most important factor
of survival being the timing of electrical cardioversion (a controlled electric shock delivered by a
defibrillator that can restart a normal
rhythm).</FONT></P>

<BR>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">In his remarks, Dr. Weisfeldt related that studies have
shown a survival rate of approximately 80 percent if an individual in VF is
cardioverted within one to two minutes of the onset of VF.  He goes on to report that survival
rates drop dramatically with each
passing minute (for example, a speaker at the 71st Scientific Sessions of the American Heart
Association in November of 1998
reported that survival drops by seven to ten percent for each minute a person is in VF), resulting
in approximately a 25 percent
chance of survival after five minutes, ten percent after ten minutes, and just five percent after
defibrillating 15 minutes after the onset
of VF.</FONT></P>

<BR>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Until recently, use of a defibrillator required a trained
professional (doctor or paramedic) to interpret the patient's heart rhythm to
determine whether defibrillation was appropriate.  First introduced in 1979, automatic external
defibrillators (AEDs) that accurately
analyze cardiac rhythms and/or deliver an electric shock when appropriate have now been
streamlined by the medical manufacturing
industry into smaller, lighter-weight, lesser expensive, easier to use, voice-prompt models that
people other than paramedics and
other medical first responders can use.  </FONT></P>

<BR>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Placed in public access areas such as airplanes, airports,
casinos, shopping malls, arenas, and fitness centers, anecdotal reports
show that the new generation of AEDs have had dramatic results in saving the lives of sudden
cardiac arrest victims.  Perhaps the
most statistically-supported beneficial effect has been the placement of AEDs in police cars.  In
many areas, a police officer is able to
respond to an emergency call in less time than an ambulance or other advanced life support
service (on average, studies have
shown a police-first response time to VF cases of 4.2 minutes vs. 6.3 minutes for EMS-first
cases).  A look at one study's average
interval from the receipt of a 911 call to delivery of the first shock showed a call-to-shock
interval of six minutes for police compared
to ten minutes for when EMS arrived first (from a talk delivered at the 71st Scientific Sessions of
the American Heart Association
Conference, November, 1998, by Dr. William Groh of Indiana University.)  Patients treated by
police had a survival-to-hospital-discharge rate of 20 percent compared to 2.9 percent of those
treated first by EMS. </FONT></P>

<BR>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Despite such dramatic results in survival numbers, it is
reported that only 30 percent of first responders (for example, police cars) are
currently equipped with AEDs.  Apparently, the major reason for placement of AEDs in squad
cars and public access places is the
concern over lawsuits when persons other than trained life support personnel use AEDs on
cardiac arrest victims.  Several states
have recently adopted laws granting civil immunity (except in cases of gross negligence) to
individuals under Good Samaritan Laws. 
In light of the improved chances of surviving a heart attack caused by VF, a joint American
Heart Association/American College of
Cardiology task force has recommended the widespread availability of AEDs, especially in
remote areas and places where trained
medical first responder personnel are not immediately available.   </FONT></P>

FACE="Arial"><EM></EM></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) restore a
normal heart rhythm for victims of sudden cardiac arrest who have one of the two
most frequent heart arrhythmias:  ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT). 
About 70 percent of cardiac arrest
victims have one or the other of these arrhythmias.  Research studies have proven that in such
cases, survival decreases by about
10 percent for each minute that a person remains in the arrhythmia.  Many emergency medical
first response systems and advanced
life support systems typically need anywhere from four to ten minutes to respond, thereby
dramatically decreasing the chances for
survival of a cardiac arrest victim.  The new generation of AEDs, with clearly marked electrodes
that show proper placement; voice
prompts that instruct the user to stand back, check for a pulse, administer CPR; and the ability to
accurately analyze a heart rhythm
and deliver the appropriate shock only when medically necessary, now provides a relatively safe
and beneficial means for a
layperson to help a cardiac victim until professional emergency medical personnel can arrive. 
The placement of AEDs in places
where people congregate -- office buildings, pools, sports arenas, concert halls,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">schools, universities, shopping malls, and so forth --
could play a major role in increasing a person's chance of surviving sudden
cardiac arrest.  However, with today's litigious climate, it is imperative that laypeople and
businesses have the assurance that their
good faith efforts to assist in a medical emergency will not result in facing a major
lawsuit.</FONT></P>

<BR>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><STRONG><EM>Against:</EM></STRONG></FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"><EM></EM></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Several municipal officials and police agencies have
expressed a concern regarding protection from civil liability for fire fighters and
police officers.  The problem appears to center around the issue of having a "duty" to respond. 
The bill extends immunity to persons
who have no duty to respond to an emergency.  Since responding to various types of emergencies
is well within the job description
of fire fighters and police officers, the bill may not extend to them.  It would seem, though, that
members of these two professions,
even volunteer fire fighters and emergency personnel, would be covered under existing
governmental immunity laws.  However,
confusion  has arisen regarding the interplay of governmental immunity laws and Part 209 of the
Public Health Code, which governs
emergency medical services.  Under the Health Code, immunity is extended to those providing
medical first response services, but
only when rendered by licensed medical first responders.  Therefore, many are concerned that to
continue to receive immunity from
civil liability when using AEDs, all fire fighters and police officers may have to become trained
and licensed as medical first
responders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><STRONG><EM>Response:</EM></STRONG></FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">This concern is unfounded.  Police officers and fire
fighters are trained in basic first aid and CPR.  Many squad cars carry oxygen
and first aid kits to assist in medical emergencies.  Assisting in medical emergencies must not be
confused with rendering the
statutory level of care that would make an agency a medical first response service or an
individual officer a medical first responder. 
The new generation of AEDs are so simple to use, that use of one would be on a level similar to
administering CPR.  Just as training
in CPR and being sent to assist in cardiac arrest cases has not made police and fire fighters
medical first response services, neither
should the routine placement of AEDs in squad cars and fire engines. </FONT></P>

<BR>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Further, in a letter sent in December 1998, by the
director of the Emergency Medical Services Division of the Department of
Consumer and Industry Services to medical control authorities (which supervise emergency
medical services within an emergency
medical services system, typically a county), the director addressed the question of whether the
use of AEDs by law enforcement
agencies and personnel made them medical first responders.  The director wrote that the Public
Health Code's definition of medical
first response service<EM> </EM>"excludes a law enforcement agency from having to meet the
medical first response service requirements<EM> if it
does not hold</EM></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><STRONG>
</STRONG></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><EM>itself out as providing this
level of care</EM>."  The director further wrote that "[t]ypically, a law enforcement officer is
not
dispatched to provide life support at the level of care of a medical first responder and is therefore
not required by Part 209 to be
trained and qualified as a medical first responder."  It would be reasonable to assume that the
above argument would apply to all
municipal employees.  In light of the information regarding the quicker response time of police
officers and other first responders as
compared with medical first responders, it is imperative that police officers be equipped with
AEDs, especially in rural areas. 
Reportedly, two rural services in Kalamazoo County saved three individuals in 1997 with the use
of an AED.  Widespread availability
of these devices would save even more lives.</FONT></P>

<BR>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><STRONG><EM>Against:</EM></STRONG></FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">Several states restrict immunity from civil liability to
those who have been trained and licensed as emergency medical services
personnel.  The state of New York requires that individuals have 40 hours of training at the
emergency medical technician level.  The
bill as introduced would have required at least four hours of training by the American Red Cross,
American Heart Association, or
other approved training program.  Some amount of training in the use of AEDs should be
restored to ensure that even laypersons
have some basic knowledge of how to safely operate the devices.  Further, without proper
training, people could assume that
learning CPR is not necessary, or they could rely too much in the benefits of an AED and fail to
call 911 to summon trained
emergency personnel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><STRONG><EM>Response:</EM></STRONG></FONT><FONT
FACE="Arial"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The New York law cited above pertains to licensed
individuals.  Though many states, including Michigan, require licensed
emergency personnel to receive a specified amount of training before using defibrillators, it does
not make it unlawful for laypersons
to use AEDs.  The bill merely extends immunity from civil lawsuits to corporations and
businesses that have AEDs available in their
buildings and facilities, and protects individuals who respond in an emergency to save the life of
a heart attack victim.  Reportedly,
about 20 states have recently extended  immunity to laypersons using AEDs, with legislation
pending in several other states.</FONT></P>

<BR>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">The majority of the supporters of the bill agree that it is
only a first step in increasing the chances of survival for victims of cardiac
arrest.  The next big hurdle will be disseminating appropriate educational materials to the public. 
An AED does not replace or
remove the need to know CPR.  Often, CPR may need to be started before using an AED in order
to clear the airway, or to keep
oxygen in the victim's system while someone else retrieves the AED.  Further, it should never be
assumed that use of AEDs by
laypersons would ever minimize the need for trained emergency medical personnel, as victims of
cardiac arrest still need medical
care, possibly even surgery, to ensure survival.  Quick use of an AED to restore a normal heart
rhythm dramatically increases a
victim's chance of survival, basically by keeping him or her alive until appropriately trained
medical personnel can arrive.  As to the
issue of training, all people should be trained in the use of an AED, just as all people should be
trained in first aid and CPR. 
However, the Good Samaritan Law provides protection from lawsuits to persons administering
CPR whether they have received
training or not.  The immunity for using an AED should be the same as for those administering
CPR.</FONT></P>
