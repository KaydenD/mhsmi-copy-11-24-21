                                Scholarships, grants, and financial aid are available to students in many forms. 
                                <br>The scholarships listed on this page are all

                            <p>By guaranteed scholarships, we mean those which
                                are unlimited in number, and require no interview, essay, portfolio, audition, competition or other "secondary" 
                                requirement. Just meet the criteria listed, adhere to the application deadlines set by the individual colleges 
                                and universities, gain admission, enroll, and receive your scholarship or scholarships. Remember that, in many
                                cases, the scholarships are mutually exclusive...you will generally receive the largest scholarship or grant 
                                for which you qualify.<br><br>And, generally, you will have to meet some minimum requirements to renew and 
                                retain any scholarships and grants awarded to you.<br><br>Despite our continuing effort to maintain the accuracy
                                of the information on this site, it is possible that one or more of the scholarships listed have been changed in
                                some way or even discontinued.&nbsp; <strong>To avoid disappointment or misunderstandings, we strongly suggest 
                                that you verify all scholarship information with the offering college or university before beginning the 
                                application process to be certain the scholarship is still being offered and to ensure that you are fully
                                aware of initial qualifying criteria, deadlines, and renewal requirements. </strong><br><br>Also, please be
                                aware that many institutions listed below offer grants, financial aid, and awards other than those listed.
                                We have only listed those meeting our definition of "guaranteed". And, be advised that many colleges require
                                anyone applying for aid to complete financial aid forms, even if they have no demonstrated financial need.
