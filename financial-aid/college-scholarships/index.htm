        students</a> are less common, they are often very generous, as many target particular
    fields of study, or are awarded by potential employers who want better-educated
    employees. Conduct a college <a href="/scholarship-search">scholarships search</a>
    or browse through our site to see the scholarships by <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-grade-level/">grade

<p>
    While <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/sports-scholarships/">sports scholarships</a> are more competitive, you do not have to be a
    star athlete to land a generous award. Most <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/sports-scholarships/"
        title="Sports Scholarships" target="_top">sports scholarships</a> will come
    directly from your college if you intend to play on their team, but if you are more
    interested in playing a club or intramural sport, you could qualify for
    scholarships from local groups and outside organizations that award sports-related scholarships. Many of those awards will
    look at criteria such as <a href="/financial-aid/grants/applying-for-grants/" title="Applying for Grants" target="_top">
        need</a>, <a href="/resources/public-service-and-volunteering/" title="Public Service and Volunteering" target="_top">

<h3 id="FAQ1">
    What is a scholarship?</h3>
<p>
    Scholarships are funds used to <a href="/financial-aid/financial-aid-information/pay-for-school/" title="Pay for School" target="_top">
        pay for higher education</a> that do not have to be repaid to the provider.
    Scholarships may be awarded based on any number of criteria including <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/academic-scholarships-and-merit-scholarships/"
        title="Academic Scholarships and Merit Scholarships" target="_top">academics</a>,
    achievements, hobbies, talents, affiliations with various groups, or career aspirations.
    They are available from the federal and <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-state/" title="Scholarships by State"
        target="_top">state</a> government, large corporations, <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/local-scholarships/"
            title="Local Scholarships" target="_top">local</a> businesses, professional
    organizations, <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/university-scholarships/" title="University Scholarships" target="_top">
        universities</a> and individuals. Each scholarship has its own requirements which must be met. Our <a href="/scholarship-search"
        title="" target="_top">scholarship search</a> can match you with the scholarships
    you qualify for and have the best chance of <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-application-strategies/winning-scholarships-attention-to-detail-will-pay-off/" title="Winning Scholarships; Attention to Detail Will Pay Off"
        target="_top">winning</a>.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ2">
    How is a scholarship different from a grant?</h3>
<p>
    Though the terms "scholarship" and "<a href="/financial-aid/grants/" title="Grants" target="_top">grant</a>"
    are often used interchangeably, there are a few differences between the two. They are
    both considered "free money", but in the majority of cases scholarships
    are awarded to students who are planning to attend or are already enrolled in some
    form of postsecondary education. Awardees are often required to maintain specific
    grade point averages, participate in <a href="/resources/college-prep/preparing-for-college/extracurricular-activities-can-translate-into-scholarship-opportunities/" title="Extracurricular Activities Can Translate Into Scholarship Opportunities"
        target="_top">certain activities</a>, or take a certain amount of credits per
    semester to remain eligible for the scholarships they earned initially. Failure
    to adhere to these guidelines results in suspension or cancellation of the
    <a href="/financial-aid/funding-your-education/" title="Funding Your Education" target="_top">funding</a>.
    Grant recipients, however, don't necessarily have to attend or plan to <a href="/resources/college-prep/attending-college/" title="Attending College" target="_top">attend college</a>:
    Grant applicants/recipients often need the funds to finance research projects (recipients are expected
    to create proposals and update the donors regularly to maintain funding) or, in
    the case for entrepreneurs or natural disaster victims, require capital to help
    start or rebuild their lives.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ3">
    How is a scholarship different from a fellowship?</h3>
<p>
    Like scholarships, <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-grade-level/graduate-scholarships/research-fellowships/" title="Research Fellowships" target="_top">
        fellowships</a> are considered gift aid and do not have to be repaid but they
    are typically only available for <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-grade-level/graduate-scholarships/" title="Graduate Scholarships"
        target="_top">graduate students</a>. Some fellowships
    include <a href="/resources/campus-life/college-costs/tuition-and-fees/" title="Tuition and Fees" target="_top">tuition</a>
    waivers or payments to universities in lieu of tuition but most include a stipend
    to cover reasonable <a href="/resources/campus-life/college-costs/college-living-expenses/" title="College Living Expenses" target="_top">
        living expenses</a>.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ4">
    How do scholarships differ from loans?</h3>
<p>
    The main difference between scholarships and <a href="/financial-aid/student-loans/" title="Student Loans"
        target="_top">loans</a> is that while scholarships do not require repayment,
    loans do, with added interest. Loans are awarded federally (<a href="/financial-aid/student-loans/direct-loans/" title="Stafford Loans"
        target="_top">Stafford</a>, Perkins and <a href="/financial-aid/student-loans/plus-loans/" title="PLUS Loans"
            target="_top">PLUS</a>) as well as privately (through banks and other lenders
    like Sallie Mae) and can be either subsidized (no payments must be made while in
    school) or unsubsidized (payments must be made while in school).</p>
<h3 id="FAQ5">
    Will winning a scholarship impact my Financial Aid package?</h3>
<p>
    It may. The government takes student <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-information/scholarship-awards/" title="Scholarship Awards"
        target="_top">awards</a> into consideration when offering aid. However, students
    should not be deterred by this. The effects are not likely to be great. Many schools
    use student money to offset <a href="/financial-aid/student-loans/" title="Student Loans" target="_top">
        loan</a> eligibility, not grant awards. Students who receive little aid can
    benefit greatly from <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-information/scholarship-opportunities/" title="Scholarship Opportunities" target="_top">
        scholarships.</a>
</p>
<h3 id="FAQ6">
    Can I still receive a scholarship, even if I do not qualify for financial aid?</h3>
<p>
    Yes, there are plenty of scholarships that aren’t based on financial need. Play
    to your strengths: If you have a high GPA, apply for <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/academic-scholarships-and-merit-scholarships/" title="Academic Scholarships and Merit Scholarships"
        target="_top">academic scholarships</a>, if you’re a great writer, apply for
    <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/essay-scholarships/" title="Essay Scholarships" target="_top">essay</a> and <a
        href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/scholarship-poetry-contests/" title="Scholarship Poetry Contests" target="_top">poetry scholarships</a>.
    If you're creative, apply for <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-major/art-scholarships/" title="Art Scholarships" target="_top">
        art</a> and <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-major/design-scholarships/" title="Design Scholarships" target="_top">design
            scholarships</a> and so forth. You could have your entire tuition
    covered by scholarships if you do your due diligence, which means you'll graduate
    with zero student loan debt.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ7">
    Why should I apply for scholarships?</h3>
<p>
   Why <i>would't</i> you apply for scholarships? A scholarship
    is free <a href="/financial-aid/find-money-for-college/" title="Find Money for College" target="_top">money for
        college</a>, that you don't have to worry about paying back, so you can spend
    more time focusing on <a href="/resources/college-prep/college-classes/" title="College Classes" target="_top">classes</a>.
    Whether it's grades, <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/sports-scholarships/" title="Sports Scholarships" target="_top">
        athleticism</a>, creativity, or being <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/technology-scholarships/" title="Technology Scholarships"
            target="_top">tech savvy</a> you are being rewarded for something you are good at, so why not take advantage of it? 
    Many students don't want to <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-application-strategies/apply-for-scholarships/" title="Apply for Scholarships" target="_top">
        apply for scholarships</a> because they fear they will not win.
    But applying for the scholarships in our <a href="/scholarship-search" title="" target="_top">scholarship search</a>
    will increase your chances of winning exponentially, because we match our scholarships based on applicants' specific qualities and interests.
    Scholarships can paired with <a href="/financial-aid/" title="Financial Aid"
        target="_top">financial aid</a> to cover the cost of <a href="/resources/campus-life/college-costs/books-and-supplies/" title="Books and Supplies"
            target="_top">books</a>, supplies, <a href="/resources/campus-life/college-costs/room-and-board/" title="Room and Board"
                target="_top">room and board</a> and even entire tuitions, but you will
    never know if that's possible unless you apply.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ8">
    What are the odds of winning a scholarship?</h3>
<p>
    It depends on the scholarship you're applying for. National scholarships will 
    have larger applicant pools than state or <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-major/" title="Scholarships by Major"
        target="_top">major-specific scholarships,</a> but they are all judged on specific
    sets of requirements. If you follow the criteria, you will have a better chance
    of winning than someone who doesn't; the same goes for students who observe <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-application-strategies/scholarship-application-deadlines/"
        title="Scholarship Application Deadlines" target="_top">deadlines</a> versus
    students who submit their applications late. You won't win a scholarship because
    of who you know; you'll earn it based on how well you follow directions, meet deadlines, and the
    caliber of your responses.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ9">
    Can I win multiple scholarships?</h3>
<p>
    Yes, but typically not from the same <a href="/scholarship-providers-resources/" title="Scholarship Providers' Resources"
        target="_top">scholarship provider</a> during the same award year. If you're
    applying to more than one scholarship, be sure to keep your <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-application-strategies/scholarship-application/"
        title="Scholarship Application" target="_top">applications</a> 
    organized. Sending the wrong materials to the wrong scholarship committee
    can guarantee you won't be receiving those <a href="/financial-aid/funding-your-education/" title="Funding Your Education"
        target="_top">funds for college</a>.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ10">
    Am I still eligible for scholarships if I am not a full-time student?</h3>
<p>
    This varies from scholarship to scholarship. Some awards require students to be
    full-time students, others are valid for students attending part-time, and some
    are offered specifically to individuals who aren’t currently enrolled but plan to
    <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/scholarships-for-returning-students/" title="Scholarships for Returning Students" target="_top">return
        to school</a> during the next semester.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ11">
    Can I win scholarships if I attend an online school?</h3>
<p>
    This depends on the school and scholarship provider. Our <a href="/scholarship-search" title=""
        target="_top">scholarship search</a> will present awards meeting your exact criteria.
    Contact your <a href="/resources/college-prep/choosing-the-right-school/" title="Choosing the Right School" target="_top">
        school</a> directly and ask about <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-information/scholarship-opportunities/" title="Scholarship Opportunities"
            target="_top">scholarship opportunities</a> available exclusively for enrolled students.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ12">
    Where can I find scholarships?</h3>
<p>
    You already have! Here on Scholarships.com,  you can fill out a profile
    granting access to the 2.7 million <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-information/scholarship-awards/" title="Scholarship Awards"
        target="_top">scholarship awards</a> in our database.
    For additional awards, speak to your <a href="/resources/college-prep/preparing-for-college/20-questions-to-ask-your-school-counselor/" title="20 Questions To Ask Your Guidance Counselor"
        target="_top">guidance counselor</a>, financial aid officer, <a href="/resources/public-service-and-volunteering/"
            title="Public Service and Volunteering" target="_top">volunteer</a> coordinator,
    coach, employer or <a href="/resources/parents-practical-guide-to-college/" title="Parents’ Practical Guide to College"
        target="_top">parents’</a> employers. Scholarships are also distributed by large
    corporations, such as <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/corporate-scholarships/google-scholarships/" title="Google Scholarships" target="_top">
        Google</a>, and local businesses alike. The <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-information/scholarship-winners-secrets-to-success/" title="Scholarship Winners' Secrets to Success"
        target="_top">winners</a> of business and corporation scholarhips will be drawn from a smaller applicant pool.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ13">
    I'm not a strong writer. Will I have to write an essay for every scholarship I'm
    applying for?</h3>
<p>
    While the majority of <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-application-strategies/" title="Scholarship Application Strategies"
        target="_top">application processes</a> entail some kind of essay
    to assess applicants' <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/writing-scholarships/" title="Writing Scholarships" target="_top">
        writing skills</a>, not all providers require one. Keep in mind that scholarships
    that do not require <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/essay-scholarships/" title="Essay Scholarships" target="_top">
        essays</a> can be more competitive, or have additional guidelines to ensure the
    right students apply. If you're having difficulty finding an essay-free scholarship,
    check out our "<a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/" title="Scholarships by Type" target="_top">Scholarships
        by Type</a>" section for <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/easy-scholarships/" title="Easy Scholarships" target="_top">
            easy scholarships</a> or <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/video-contest-scholarships/" title="Video Contest Scholarships"
                target="_top">video scholarships</a>, where applicants produce short
    multimedia pieces instead of writing traditional essays.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ14">
    Who should I ask to write me a letter of recommendation,
    and when should I ask them?</h3>
<p>
    Teachers, coaches, employers or volunteer supervisors are all excellent choices
    for <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-application-strategies/scholarship-letter-of-recommendation-advice/" title="The Scholarship Letter of Recommendation" target="_top">
        letters of recommendation</a> because they can detail your strengths and achievements
    in ways that appeal to scholarship committees. Do not ask <a href="/resources/parents-practical-guide-to-college/"
        title="Parents' Practical Guide to College" target="_top">parents</a>, relatives
    or your peers, because their references carry less weight than a professional reference. 
    Request their assistance at least 2-3 weeks before the <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-application-strategies/scholarship-application-deadlines/"
        title="Scholarship Application Deadlines" target="_top">application deadline</a>.
    Professors typically write more than one, so asking in a timely
    manner is not only appreciated but will likely yield a more thoughtful letter.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ15">
    When should I start applying for scholarships?</h3>
<p>
    The sooner the better. Eligibility requirements such as
    "you must be a <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-grade-level/high-school-scholarships/scholarships-for-high-school-seniors/" title="Scholarships for High School Seniors"
        target="_top">high school senior</a>", "you must be a college sophomore majoring
    in <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-major/computer-science-scholarships/" title="Computer Science Scholarships" target="_top">computer
        science</a>", "you must be under the age of 30, etc." vary. Regardless of the requirements, if you miss the deadline
    you will not receive a scholarship. For precaution, make sure your application
    packet is complete at least two weeks before the <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-application-strategies/scholarship-application-deadlines/" title="Scholarship Application Deadlines"
        target="_top">deadline</a>, in case you have to resubmit due to a mailing/emailing error.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ16">
Can my parents apply for scholarships on my behalf?</h3>
<p>
    Your parents can certainly help you throughout the process, however
    you must be the one to <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-application-strategies/scholarship-application/"
        title="Scholarship Application" target="_top">fill out the application</a>,
    <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-application-strategies/top-10-tips-for-writing-effective-scholarship-essays/" title="Top 10 Tips for Writing Effective Scholarship Essays"
        target="_top">write the essay</a>, complete necessary supplements and sign the
    appropriate forms. Your <a href="/resources/parents-practical-guide-to-college/" title="Parents’ Practical Guide to College"
        target="_top">parents</a> can assist you in securing your transcripts and even
    stamping your envelope, but if it is determined that they did the bulk of the work
     you will be ineligible to receive the <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-information/scholarship-awards/" title="Scholarship Awards"
        target="_top">award</a>.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ17">
    I have a question about the scholarship, can I contact the scholarship provider directly?</h3>
<p>
    This should be detailed in the scholarship's regulations and guidelines.
    The <a href="/scholarship-providers-resources/" title="Scholarship Providers' Resources" target="_top">scholarship
        provider</a> may have the answer to your question but if they have a strict
    "no call" or "no e-mail" policy, DO NOT call or e-mail. Instead, speak to your <a
        href="/resources/college-prep/preparing-for-college/20-questions-to-ask-your-school-counselor/" title="20 Questions To Ask Your Guidance Counselor" target="_top">
        guidance counselor</a> or financial aid officer; they've probably encountered
    the same questions in past years and will be able to point you in the right direction. </p>
<h3 id="FAQ18">
    Will I have to pay an Application Fee?</h3>
<p>
    Scholarships.com does not list any scholarships that require application
    fees but there are some scholarships out there that might. It's ultimately your decision
    whether or not you want to <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-application-strategies/apply-for-scholarships/" title="Apply for Scholarships"
        target="_top">apply for a scholarship</a> that has an application fee.
    <p>
        <h3 id="FAQ19">
            How do I know if I've won a scholarship?</h3>
        <p>
            Someone from the scholarship committee should contact you directly via phone or email by a specific date so it's essential to make yourself as available as possible as
            that time draws closer. The funds will then be sent to you or the school you will
            be attending during the next semester. If someone from a third-party organization
            claims they need personal information (Social Security number, bank account numbers,
            and so forth) to complete the award process, it could be a <a href="/financial-aid/financial-aid-tips/protecting-yourself-against-scholarship-scams/" title="Protecting Yourself Against Scholarship Scams"
                target="_top">scam</a>; get as much information about the solicitor as possible
            without divulging your details and contact the scholarship provider directly to
            determine your next step.
        </p>
        <h3 id="FAQ20">
            Will I have to reapply each year, such as required for FAFSA? </h3>
        <p>
            Scholarships generally come in three <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/" title="Scholarships by Type"
                target="_top">varieties</a>: one-time, renewable, or renewable with stipulations.
            One-time awards are granted only once, while renewable scholarships
            are granted each year. Some are dispensed automatically each year after the initial
            <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-information/scholarship-awards/" title="Scholarship Awards" target="_top">award</a> but most
            renewable awards call for the recipient to reapply or provide transcripts and progress
            reports to ensure they are still meeting the guidelines set by the scholarship committee.
            If you were awarded for your <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/academic-scholarships-and-merit-scholarships/" title="Academic Scholarships and Merit Scholarships"
                target="_top">stellar grades</a> or <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/sports-scholarships/" title="Sports Scholarships"
                    target="_top">athletic achievement</a>, a low GPA or nonparticipation on
            a university team could discontinue your award so check with your
            <a href="/scholarship-providers-resources/" title="Scholarship Providers' Resources" target="_top">scholarship
                provider</a> to determine what is required for continued funding.</p>
