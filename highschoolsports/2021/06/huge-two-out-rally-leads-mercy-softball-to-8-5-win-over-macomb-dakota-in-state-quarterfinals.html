However, the hit almost didn’t happen. It initially appeared as if the Dakota center fielder was going to pull off a great play and snag Murphy’s hit after a great effort to chase it down. However, the ball was able to escape the webbing of the outstretched mitt and, suddenly, Mercy had some momentum as it cut Dakota’s lead to 4-3.</p><div class="InContent_Center_Background"><div class="InContent_Center_Padding"><div id="InContent_Center_SXLGIKGJZ5AM5AHX2ZIAVYD43Y" class="ad-observer"></div></div></div><div id="inarticle-10"></div><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GKU6AHAAYVE2FFVU5KDPQLZKIE">Junior third baseman Kendall Spivey stepped up to the plate next and ripped a single up the middle to score Murphy and tie the game at 4-4. After an infield single by freshman pitcher Asia Barbato, sophomore Sabrina Shea put the ball in play in the infield and reached first base on a throwing error, allowing Spivey to score in the process.</p><div class="InContent_Center_Background"><div class="InContent_Center_Padding"><div id="InContent_Center_GKU6AHAAYVE2FFVU5KDPQLZKIE" class="ad-observer"></div></div></div><div id="inarticle-11" class="middleParagraph"></div><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PAVSH7AIJRBNHJ6FIUO5BS7PYI">Freshman catcher Kat Burras then capped the rally in a big way by scoring both Barbato and Shea with a single to left field.</p><div class="InContent_Center_Background"><div class="InContent_Center_Padding"><div id="InContent_Center_PAVSH7AIJRBNHJ6FIUO5BS7PYI" class="ad-observer"></div></div></div><div id="inarticle-12"></div><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2PE62SC7QBEZBM57DVENQGWCDA">“I had a lot of support from behind the dugout,” Kat Burras said. “Everyone was cheering me on, and I think that a key point with my hits, going 3-for-3, that was mainly my team pushing me along...

However, Burras fielded a ball in play near the catcher, and instead of throwing the ball to first, she rifled a throw to third base where Spivey made the catch and an acrobatic move to catch the runner trying to return to the bag for the out.</p><div class="InContent_Center_Background"><div class="InContent_Center_Padding"><div id="InContent_Center_77IGNHXACJHZZPSUUC56SZTVFU" class="ad-observer"></div></div></div><div id="inarticle-14"></div><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Q4GOLAHCRFGUBDUW4M27PNDXYI">I got the tag and I just barely got it,” Spivey said. “And then I looked around... It was a really big out to get at third. I think that really helped the game because it was in a tight predicament, but I feel like that moved the inning forward.”</p><div class="InContent_Center_Background"><div class="InContent_Center_Padding"><div id="InContent_Center_Q4GOLAHCRFGUBDUW4M27PNDXYI" class="ad-observer"></div></div></div><div id="inarticle-15"></div><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FISBGCUTJVHHDNTGLNVXLBQ3OE">After the next Dakota batter flew out to right field, Spivey got the last out of the inning by catching a low line drive at third base to end the inning and preserving the 7-4 lead. Of course, Spivey fielded the final hit of the game and threw the runner out at first to send the team into a celebration.</p><div class="InContent_Center_Background"><div class="InContent_Center_Padding"><div id="InContent_Center_FISBGCUTJVHHDNTGLNVXLBQ3OE" class="ad-observer"></div></div></div><div id="inarticle-16"></div><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FDS7OYFA65GAXIKDTAQE6KCHSA">“Champions rise to the occasion,” Corey Burras said. “That just took the momentum.
