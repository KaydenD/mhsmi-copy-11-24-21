It’s just amazing. Her coming here and celebrating with us, it’s just great to know that she puts what she wants aside just to celebrate with our team. She’s been teammates with mine since we were both 10, so it’s great because it’s just so much more than volleyball. It’s a friendship that will last a lifetime.”</p><div class="InContent_Center_Background"><div class="InContent_Center_Padding"><div id="InContent_Center_5IUCW52NIFFJNBXACJGRVDOZIM" class="ad-observer"></div></div></div><div id="inarticle-6"></div><p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OW5YJRBD6NGBDNOMZAEXZA456U">This season, Bishop helped lead Mercy to the Division 1 state quarterfinals where it lost a tough five-set match to rival Bloomfield Hills Marian.

I think it really shows that it’s not an individual sport and it really shows that I can’t do anything without everyone else. It’s a lot of relying on other people as a setter, but it’s obvious that relying means trust and everyone puts their trust in me to make decisions with the ball, and I put my trust in them.
